# Roadmap

The roadmap is a living document, and it is likely that priorities will change, but the list below should give some indication of our plans for the next major release, and for the future.

## v0.15.3 (expected in August)

We are mainly focusing on **bug fixes** :boom:.

New features have low priority and might not be reviewed nor merged.

## [v0.16.0](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/milestone/14) (expected in the next couple months)

The next release is going to be huge :sparkles:

Material-UI was started [2 years ago](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/commit/28b768913b75752ecf9b6bb32766e27c241dbc46).
The ecosystem has evolved a lot since then, we have also learned a lot.
[@nathanmarks](https://github.com/nathanmarks/) started an ambitious task, rebuilding Material-UI from the **ground-up**
taking advantage of this knowledge to address long-standing issues.
Expect various breaking changes.

The core team is now helping him in the [`next`](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/next) branch.
Here are some issues that we plan to fix along the way.
